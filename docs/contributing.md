## Development

You need a working `python` environment (system, virtualenv, pyenv, etc) version 3.7 or superior.

Then install the dependencies and a development instance using:

```bash
make build
```

To run tests for this package:

```bash
make test
```

By default we use the latest Plone version in the 6.x series.
